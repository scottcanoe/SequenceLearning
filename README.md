# SequenceLearning
This notebook accompanies [Learned Response Dynamics Reflect Stimulus Timing and Encode Temporal Expectation Violations in Superficial Layers of Mouse V1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.20.576433v1). The full dataset and other modules imported by the notebook can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UFtn02RWI61EJdWjNzvZ-auOD29QgdJs?usp=drive_link). It's preferable to open the notebook in Colab rather than GitHub since code formatting is messed up in GitHub.
